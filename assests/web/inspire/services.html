					<h2 style="padding-top: 3%; text-align: center;">Our Services</h2>
					<h3 style="padding-top: 3%;">Therapeutic Riding v. Hippotherapy</h3>
					<p class="first">Initially, Inspiration Stables will offer only Therapeutic Riding (TR) services to special needs children ages 4-17.  TR by PATH, Intl. definition is "an equine-assisted activity for the purpose of contributing positively to the cognitive, physical, emotional and social well-being of individuals with special needs."  In TR, lessons are adapted for individuals with special needs in order to help them achieve their desired goals while learning proper horsemanship and riding skills.</p>
					<p class="first">Hippotherapy by American Hippotherapy Association and PATH definition is "a physical, occupational or speech therapy treatment strategy that utilizes equine movement.  The word hippotherapy derives from the Greek word hippos, meaning horse.  The term hippotherapy refers to the use of the movement of the hrose as a treatment strategy by physical therapists, occupational therapists and speech/language pathologists to address impairments, functional limitations and disabilities in patients with neuromotor and sensory dysfunction.  This treatment strategy is used as part of an integrated treatment program to achieve functional goals."  Inspiration Stables plans to add a Hippotherapy program in 2019.</p>

				<div class="text-services">
					<h3 style="padding-top: 3%;">Theraputic Riding Lessons</h3>
					<p class="first">Each Theraputic Riding lesson is designed to help our participants to achieve their individual goals as well as an overall increase in physical strength and balance, improved confidence and self-awareness, and enhanced communication skills.</p>
					<h3 style="padding-top: 3%;">Hippotherapy</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="text-services">
					<p class="first">Our hippotherapy currently serves pediatric physical therapy clients on horseback.  Our pediatric physical and hippotherapist conducts 30-minute client sessions weekly to focus on specific therapy goals as determined in conjunction with the family and physicians.  Strength, flexibility, posture, stability, muscle control, large and fine motor skills are all goals that can be addressed through the hippotherapy program.</p>
					<h3 style="padding-top: 3%;">Equine-Assisted Learning</h3>
					<h4>Why Horses?</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="text-services">
					<p class="first">Horses are flight animals and are incredibly intuitive to the present moment. These 1200-pound animals help us become completely aware of our immediate existence and what is happening in the now. As “busyness-people” and “multi-tasking” executives, we are running a million miles an hour in our minds. Tackling problems, worrying, planning, processing, we are always in constant motion. With all this clutter, we don’t see what’s right in front of us nor how it is affecting us, those around us, and the outcome of our work and life. Horses take us from this chaos and bring us to the now…immediately. It’s pretty difficult to stand next to these powerful, sentient beings and not be acutely aware of them, if not ourselves. They are amazing in every aspect of the word. Physically, they have strength and power that can seem overwhelming to us as humans. Emotionally, they feel to their core and act purely on their intuition in the moment. Their ability to teach us is difficult to put into words. Their intuitive nature protects them, and their reactions allow us to see inside ourselves. Their herd dynamics teach us about communication, mostly importantly, the value of non-verbal communication.</p>
