						In building Inspiration Stables, Sarah carefully enlisted the help and guidance of people she was inspired to reach out to.  The executive team and board were not people that she knew her whole life or had any stake in getting the program started.  They were brought to her in order to set a solid foundation for an incredible organization to take hold.  She is grateful for the amazing gift the team has been and how far they have taken Inspiration Stables already.

						Our mission at Inspiration Stables is inspiring hearts and hooves to build lasting relationships to promote wellness, healing, self-expression and meaning.  This mission speaks to the heart of why Sarah built this organization.  She believes that horses have a unique power to help us as humans learn, heal, and grow to be better versions of ourselves through their inherent nature to live in the present and be mirrors to our inner selves.  Our primary goal in our early years is to create a thriving therapeutic horseback riding program for children with special needs.  As we grow, our mission allows us to expand to provide ever-changing services to anyone wanting to step outside their comfort zone to learn with a horse.
					</p>
					<p class="other">
						Our vision for the future is to expand to our own property with a healthy acreage where we can build a heated barn and indoor arena space to allow us to provide year round services to all who benefit from our mission.  We plan to add hippotherapy services in 2019 in partnership with local therapy providers.  We are continually expanding our equine-assisted learning programs to include team building, individual coaching, yoga, and more to come.

						Please take the opportuntiy to see how you can join the Inspiration Stables family. There is a home for everyone within our family whether as a participant in equine-assisted activities, volunteer for lessons or horse care, committee member to help with special projects, someone to advocate for our services, donor to help a child participate who otherwise wouldn't be able to, or in any capacity you feel called.  We appreciate what you uniquely bring to the table, and want you on our team!
